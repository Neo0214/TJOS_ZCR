问题回答在实验报告中

Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?

a0-a7保留函数参数
a2寄存器保留了参数13

Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)

没有直接调用函数f()和g()，编辑器将两个函数做了内联优化，f(x)被内联到main()，g(x)被内联到f(x)

At what address is the function printf located?

0x630

What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?

0x38

What is the output?

微信截图留存

The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output?

unsigned int i=0x726c6400;

Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?

不需要，因为大小端序的57616的十六进制都是E110

what is going to be printed after 'y='? 

printf被调用时a2寄存器的值是什么，就会输出什么。具体输出与执行到printf函数时a2寄存器的内容有关，不是固定的

Why does this happen?

因为没有传递第二个参数，a2寄存器没有被赋指定值
